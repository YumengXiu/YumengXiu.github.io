<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).-->

I am a graduated student at Department of Mechanical Engineering, CMU. I am broadly interested in robotics, learning to control and optimization, my research goal is to develop real autonomous intelligent robots. Particularly, my recent researches focus on following directions:

- <strong>Safe Navigation and robotics</strong>: Safe exploration and navigation is one of the most fundamental components of robot autonomy. Therefore, an accurate perception system and safe trajectory planning/prediction algorithms become necessary for safe navigation in complex environments. My goal is to develop rigorous algorithms to enable safe and autonomous actions in the field of robotics and apply them on real-world applications. Toward this goal, I've worked on research projects of [Vision Aided Path Planning](https://yumengxiu.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/), [Perception and Obstacle Avoidance](https://yumengxiu.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/), and [Multi-robot Social Navigation](https://yumengxiu.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-4/) to enrich my experince.

- <strong>Learning to control</strong>: While control theory provides useful concepts and tools for machine learning, machine learning can be used the other way around to solve large control problems.I believe that combining these two could help develop reliable algorithms for stabilizing large-scale systems in practice, including power systems, robot teams, etc. Toward this goal, I've been working on the project of [Learning-based Control on Large Power System](https://yumengxiu.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)

Previously in my Master study, I worked on multi-robot social navigation with Prof. [Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/), developing learning-based control algorithms with [Prof. Guannan Qu](https://www.guannanqu.com/), developing perceptio and planning algorithms for aerial vehicles with Prof. Kenji Shimada.

My up-to-date Curriculum: [CV](../files/YumengXiu_CV.pdf)

Besides research, I enjoy music arranging, photography and philosophy. I'm a fan of Albert Camus and Victor Hugo.
